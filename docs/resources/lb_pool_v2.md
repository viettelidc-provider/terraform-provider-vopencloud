## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_lb_pool_v2" "pool_1" {
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  lb_method   = "ROUND_ROBIN"
  listener_id = "d9415786-5f1a-428b-b35f-2f1523e146d2"

  persistence {
    type        = "APP_COOKIE"

* `loadbalancer_id` - (Optional) The load balancer on which to provision this
    pool. Changing this creates a new pool.
    Note:  One of LoadbalancerID or ListenerID must be provided.
