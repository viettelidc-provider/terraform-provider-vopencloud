## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Glance client.
   A Glance client is needed to manage Image members. If omitted, the `region`
   argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new resource.

* `image_id` - (Required) The image ID.

* `member_id` - (Required) The member ID, e.g. the target project ID.

* `status` - (Optional) The member proposal status. Optional if admin wants to
  force the member proposal acceptance. Can either be `accepted`, `rejected` or
  `pending`. Defaults to `pending`. Foridden for non-admin users.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `created_at` - The date the image access was created.
* `updated_at` - The date the image access was last updated.
* `schema` - The member schema.

## Import

Image access can be imported using the `image_id` and the `member_id`,
separated by a slash, e.g.

```
