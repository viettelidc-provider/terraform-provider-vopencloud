# viettelidc\_identity\_application\_credential\_v3

Manages a V3 Application Credential resource within ViettelIdc Keystone.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the application credential name and secret
will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data
in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html).

~> **Note:** An Application Credential is created within the authenticated user
project scope and is not visible by an admin or other accounts.
The Application Credential visibility is similar to
[`viettelidc_compute_keypair_v2`](compute_keypair_v2.html).

## Example Usage

### Predefined secret

Application credential below will have only one `swiftoperator` role.

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_identity_application_credential_v3" "swift" {
  name        = "swift"
  description = "Swift technical application credential"
  secret      = "supersecret"
  roles       = ["swiftoperator"]
  expires_at  = "2019-02-13T12:12:12Z"
}
```

### Unrestricted with autogenerated secret and unlimited TTL

Application credential below will inherit all the current user's roles.

!> **WARNING:** Restrictions on these Identity operations are deliberately
imposed as a safeguard to prevent a compromised application credential from
regenerating itself. Disabling this restriction poses an inherent added risk.

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_identity_application_credential_v3" "unrestricted" {
  name         = "unrestricted"
  description  = "Unrestricted application credential"
  unrestricted = true
}

output "application_credential_secret" {
  value = viettelidc_identity_application_credential_v3.unrestricted.secret
}
```

### Application credential with access rules

~> **Note:** Application Credential access rules are supported only in Keystone
starting from [Train](https://releases.openstack.org/train/highlights.html#keystone-identity-service) release.

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_identity_application_credential_v3" "monitoring" {
  name        = "monitoring"
  expires_at  = "2019-02-13T12:12:12Z"

  access_rules {
    path    = "/v2.0/metrics"
    service = "monitoring"
    method  = "GET"
  }

  access_rules {
    path    = "/v2.0/metrics"
    service = "monitoring"
    method  = "PUT"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V3 Keystone client.
    If omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this
    creates a new application credential.

* `name` - (Required) A name of the application credential. Changing this
    creates a new application credential.

* `description` - (Optional) A description of the application credential.
    Changing this creates a new application credential.

* `unrestricted` - (Optional) A flag indicating whether the application
    credential may be used for creation or destruction of other application
    credentials or trusts. Changing this creates a new application credential.

* `secret` - (Optional) The secret for the application credential. If omitted,
    it will be generated by the server. Changing this creates a new application
    credential.

* `roles` - (Optional) A collection of one or more role names, which this
    application credential has to be associated with its project. If omitted,
    all the current user's roles within the scoped project will be inherited by
    a new application credential. Changing this creates a new application
    credential.

* `access_rules` - (Optional) A collection of one or more access rules, which
    this application credential allows to follow. The structure is described
    below. Changing this creates a new application credential.

* `expires_at` - (Optional) The expiration time of the application credential
    in the RFC3339 timestamp format (e.g. `2019-03-09T12:58:49Z`). If omitted,
    an application credential will never expire. Changing this creates a new
    application credential.

The `access_rules` block supports:

* `id` - (Computed) The ID of the existing access rule. The access rule ID of
  another application credential can be provided.

* `path` - (Optional) The API path that the application credential is permitted
  to access. May use named wildcards such as **{tag}** or the unnamed wildcard
  **\*** to match against any string in the path up to a **/**, or the recursive
  wildcard **\*\*** to include **/** in the matched path.

* `service` - (Optional) The service type identifier for the service that the
  application credential is granted to access. Must be a service type that is
  listed in the service catalog and not a code name for a service. E.g.
  **identity**, **compute**, **volumev3**, **image**, **network**,
  **object-store**, **sharev2**, **dns**, **key-manager**, **monitoring**, etc.

* `method` - (Optional) The request method that the application credential is
  permitted to use for a given API endpoint. Allowed values: `POST`, `GET`,
  `HEAD`, `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `region` - See Argument Reference above.
* `name` - See Argument Reference above.
* `description` - See Argument Reference above.
* `unrestricted` - See Argument Reference above.
* `secret` - See Argument Reference above.
* `roles` - See Argument Reference above.
* `access_rules` - See Argument Reference above.
* `expires_at` - See Argument Reference above.
* `project_id` - The ID of the project the application credential was created
    for and that authentication requests using this application credential will
    be scoped to.

## Import

Application Credentials can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import viettelidc_identity_application_credential_v3.application_credential_1 c17304b7-0953-4738-abb0-67005882b0a0
```
