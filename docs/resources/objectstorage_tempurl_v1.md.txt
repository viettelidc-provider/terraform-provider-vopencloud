  Generate a TempURL for a Swift container and object.

# viettelidc\_objectstorage\_tempurl\_v1

Use this resource to generate an OpenStack Object Storage temporary URL.

The temporary URL will be valid for as long as TTL is set to (in seconds).
Once the URL has expired, it will no longer be valid, but the resource
will remain in place. If you wish to automatically regenerate a URL, set
the `regenerate` argument to `true`. This will create a new resource with
a new ID and URL.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_objectstorage_container_v1" "container_1" {
  name = "test"
  metadata = {
    Temp-URL-Key = "testkey"
  }
}

resource "viettelidc_objectstorage_object_v1" "object_1" {
  container_name = viettelidc_objectstorage_container_v1.container_1.name
  name           = "test"
  content        = "Hello, world!"
}

resource "viettelidc_objectstorage_tempurl_v1" "obj_tempurl" {
  container = viettelidc_objectstorage_container_v1.container_1.name
  object    = viettelidc_objectstorage_object_v1.object_1.name
  method    = "post"
  ttl       = 20
}
```
