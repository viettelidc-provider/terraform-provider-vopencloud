# sharedfilesystem\_securityservice\_v2

Use this resource to configure a security service.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the security service password will be
stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in
state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

A security service stores configuration information for clients for
authentication and authorization (AuthN/AuthZ). For example, a share server
will be the client for an existing service such as LDAP, Kerberos, or
Microsoft Active Directory.

Minimum supported Manila microversion is 2.7.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "viettelidc_sharedfilesystem_securityservice_v2" "securityservice_1" {
  name        = "security"
  description = "created by terraform"
  type        = "active_directory"
  server      = "192.168.199.10"
  dns_ip      = "192.168.199.10"
  domain      = "example.com"
  ou          = "CN=Computers,DC=example,DC=com"
  user        = "joinDomainUser"
  password    = "s8cret"
}
```

* `dns_ip` - (Optional) The security service DNS IP address that is used inside the
    tenant network.

* `ou` - (Optional) The security service ou. An organizational unit can be added to
